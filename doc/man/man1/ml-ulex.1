.SH "NAME"
ml\-ulex \- a Unicode\-compatible lexical analyser generator for Standard ML
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBml\-ulex\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] \fIfile\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBML\-Ulex\fP is a lexer generator that supports Unicode characters (in UTF\-8 representation) and
an extended form of regular expressions.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-32\fP
.RS 4
run the 32\-bit version of the program (currently the default).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-64\fP
.RS 4
run the 64\-bit version of the program.  This option only applies to
the \fBx86\-64\fP (aka \fBamd64\fP) architecture.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-dot\fP
.RS 4
generate DOT output (\c
.URL "http://www.graphviz.org" "" ")."
The generated file will be named \f(CRfile.dot\fP,
where \f(CRfile\fP is the input file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-match\fP
.RS 4
enter interactive matching mode.  This will allow interactive testing of the machine; presently,
only the \f(CRINITIAL\fP start state is available for testing
(see the \c
.URL "http://www.smlnj.org/doc/ml\-lpt/manual.pdf" "User Guide" " "
for details on start states).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-ml\-lex\-mode\fP
.RS 4
operate in \fBml\-lex\fP compatibility mode.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-table\-based\fP
.RS 4
generate a table\-based lexer.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-fn\-based\fP
.RS 4
generate a lexer that represents states as functions and transitions as tail calls.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-minimize\fP
.RS 4
generate a minimal machine.  Note that this is slow, and is almost never necessary.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-strict\-sml\fP
.RS 4
generate strict SML (\fIi.e.\fP, do not use SML/NJ extensions).  This flag
is useful if you want to use the output with a different SML system.
